Most of my career I have focused on the creation of twined linen vessels which have been exhibited at some of the finest galleries and museums in the country. Using natural fibrous materials, I combine paper-making, hand-weaving and stitching techniques to create works which are intuitive representations of emotional life experiences. The repetitive nature of the creative process results in periods of meditation which reveal a new psychological understanding of the work. The work can then seem to take on a life of its own and evolve into something different from my original concept. I have always been inspired by natural organic forms, mythical stories and life-altering experiences. Recently, I have experimented with the use of human hair and am particularly intrigued by the interplay of light with these hair pieces.  In much of my work I attempt to “push the envelope” both with respect to the types of materials I use and the personal nature of my artistic statement(s).
