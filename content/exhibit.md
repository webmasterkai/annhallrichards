## Perpetual Detail
**September 10 - November 21, 2014**

This exhibition feature new works by Ann Hall Richards, a widely- exhibited artist who uses repetitive and meditative textile techniques to transform common objects into contemporary and contemplative works that invite and even challenge the viewer to consider not only the content, but also the process and choice of materials. The artist collects or gathers small objects such as fabric fragments, leaves or hair, which she then transforms into larger works using repetitive processes such as assembling, stitching and/or twining. The finished works have an impact far greater than the individual collected objects, challenging the viewer to consider the value of such materials as artistic expression.
