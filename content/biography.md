I am a full-time, self-employed artist and designer residing in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  For almost 20 years, I have combined paper-making and hand-weaving techniques to create fiber sculptures which have been exhibited at some of the finest galleries and museums throughout the country, including the Smithsonian Instituteâ€™s National Building Museum.  More recently, I have focused on the design and production of custom lighting, both commercial and residential, in addition to other areas of interior design and production, particularly in connection with the use of textiles.  I continue to design and produce custom clothing, costumes and accessories.  I am also one of the founders of the Mentorship Program at the Minnesota Textile Center and have been an Artist Mentor since the inception of that program.
